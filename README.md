# scRNA-seq-Data-Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains scripts for the analysis of human glioblastoma single-cell transcriptomes. The purpose of this workflow is to identify transcriptional programs associated with mTOR signaling, interferon response, and mesenchymal versus proneural cellular states. 

## Datasets

This workflow utilizes two publicly available human glioblastoma scRNA-seq datasets from 10x Genomics v3 chemistry:

* SL040
* SL057

These datasets each contain data from over 100,000 cells of human glioblastoma tumor core tissue and the matching macroscopically normal cortex tissue. These datasets can be downloaded from this link: https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/datasets
